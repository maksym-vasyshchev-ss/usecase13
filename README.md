# 5 Assumptions
1. The system will not store user's data. Once user enters data, the taxes are calculated and shown.
2. There is no need to manage user's registration.
3. Tax regulator will communicate with user, if needed, using other means of communication, not through the system.
4. The client has no preference toward a specific cloud provider, software vendor or hosting type. 
5. The client has no regulatory contraints to fulfill.
